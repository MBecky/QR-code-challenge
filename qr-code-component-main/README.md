## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

My first project with HTML & CSS outside of a tutorial. Really good to workout the requirements myself and satisfying to see it come together.

I opted for inline CSS as it is a small project and listed the style attributes for easier reading.

### Continued development

My plan is to work through the Frontend Mentor projects so that I am fluent and confident in using HTML & basic CSS without checking my tutorial notes or looking up the foundational information.
